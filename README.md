This repository contains companion code which complements the paper "Approximation Techniques with MATLAB" published in the Dolomites Research Notes on Approximation Journal. Ref: http://drna.padovauniversitypress.it/2022/2/10
The paper and code snippets are about the following topics:
* Function approximation
o uniform approximation with Bernstein polynomials and Bézier curves
o L^2-approximation with Jacobi polynomials and Fourier series
* Wavelets Analysis in L^2(R)
o Continuous and Discrete Wavelet Transform
o Multiresolution Analysis
* Radial Basis Functions
o Scattered Data Interpolation
o Surrogate Global Optimization with cubic RBF
o Support Vector Machines with RBF kernels
* Neural Networks
o Universal Approximators
o Approximation of the dynamic state of an Extended Kalman Filter.
